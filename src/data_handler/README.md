# Data Handler for Corpora Creation

Required: [python 3.11](https://docs.python.org/3.11/contents.html)


## What is this folder for?
In this folder are the preprocessing steps to collect relevant information for a corpus
with annotated political speeches and to transform the data into usable MongoDB database 
documents. Also there are the steps to evaluate the annotation process.

### Models
- `Annotation`: has all relevant attributes for an annotated sentence, like analyzed verb with index, basic and contextual meaning and label
- `Politician`: information about potential used politician with name and party
- `Speech`: speech from DWDS corpus with corresponding speaker as Politician object
- `TroFi_Dataset`: transformed Annotation objects in TroFi structure

The corresponding MongoDB collections can be found in `data/collections/`.

### Controller
- CrawlerController: Offers three different web crawlers that can be used for the URLs listed in the main script.
- XMLReaderController: Reads a xml with potential political speeches from path and transform them to documents.
- CSVController: Reads a csv file of annotations, find the basic meaning by using the duden api and transform them to annotation documents.
- TrofiCollectionController: Transforms annotation documents into TroFi documents.
- AgreementController: Compute Cohen's and Fleiss' Kappa for evaluate the annotation process.

## Workflows
- Preprocessing
- Evaluation of annotation process
