Some weights of DistilBertForTokenClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-german-cased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
